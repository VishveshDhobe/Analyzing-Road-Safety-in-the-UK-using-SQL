## Questions:

1. Which city corresponds to the best customers?
2. The highest number of invoices belongs to which country?
3. Name the best customer (customer who spent the most money).
4. Suppose you want to host a rock concert in a city and want to know which location should host it. Query the dataset to find the city with the most rock-music listeners to answer this question.
5. If you want to know which artists the store should invite, find out who is the highest-paid and most-listened-to.
