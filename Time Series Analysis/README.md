# Time Series Analysis
Time series data is a collection of variables whose values depend on time. 


## Dataset: 

 Use the SuperStore Time Series Dataset from Kaggle to work on this project. The dataset contains 20 columns, namely, Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, and City.


## Questions:

1.	Use the LEAD window function to create a new column sales_next that displays the sales of the next row in the dataset. This function will help you quickly compare a given rowâ€™s values and values in the next row.
2.	Create a new column sales_previous to display the values of the row above a given row.
3.	Rank the data based on sales in descending order using the RANK function.
4.	Use common SQL commands and aggregate functions to show the monthly and daily sales averages.
5.	Evaluate moving averages using the window functions.
